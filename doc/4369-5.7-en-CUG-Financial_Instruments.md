## 1 Introduction

This topic is for customization specialists. It describes changes that you may need to make to your existing customization before you upgrade to Avaloq Core release 5.7. [cite: 14]

### 1.1 Replacement of EVAL_SCEN_CSS by EVAL_CSS

You can opt to update your customization for this change before upgrading to Avaloq Core release 5.7: [cite: 15]

* In releases 5.2 to 5.6, the Asset Evaluation Engine supports both the new and the old customization. [cite: 15] By default it continues to use the old customization, but you can set the `avq.ae` base parameter's `use_legacy_param` item to `false` to enable the new customization described in this section. [cite: 16, 17]
* Starting with release 5.7, the new customization will automatically be used. [cite: 18]
* For releases 5.7 and above, both parameters need to be set to `false`. This is mandatory for all clients. [cite: 19]

The following changes in customization are included in the Avaloq Asset Evaluation Engine in release 5.7: [cite: 20]

* The source EVAL_SCEN_CSS is removed and replaced by the EVAL_CSS source. [cite: 20]
* The task Calculate evaluation scenarios (id: 1847; task_eval_scen) no longer exists. [cite: 21] It was originally used to improve performance, but is no longer needed. There is no replacement. [cite: 22]
* The checkbox `use pre-calculated values` on task Evaluation of financial products program (id: 1848; task_eval) is removed because task Calculate evaluation scenarios no longer exists. [cite: 23]
* The following eval css functions need to be overwritten in customization, as the return values of 'null' in kernel are no longer mapped automatically to the kernel models: [cite: 24]
    * `cf_mdl_id`: must return `code_eval_mdl.dcf`. [cite: 24] At the moment there is no other model available. [cite: 25]
    * `opt_mdl_id`: must return the appropriate option pricing models, depending on the asset class, for example `code_eval_mdl.bs` for equity, commodity and FX options. [cite: 25]

In the past, the Asset Evaluation Engine had a lot of performance and memory problems associated with the use of the MEM_DOC_ASSET data dictionary by the EVAL_SCEN_CSS source. [cite: 26] The problems were caused by the fact that the asset order was loaded into memory. [cite: 27] To solve these problems, in Avaloq Core release 5.7 we: [cite: 28]

* Changed the data dictionary used by the Asset Evaluation Engine's customization from MEM_DOC_ASSET to a new data dictionary, MEM_ASSET [cite: 28]
* Replaced the CSS source used by the Asset Evaluation Engine from EVAL_SCEN_CSS to a new source, EVAL_CSS [cite: 28]

The new MEM_ASSET data dictionary is faster because asset orders are no longer loaded into memory. [cite: 29] It is accessed by the new customization source EVAL_CSS. [cite: 29]

For all functions of the new EVAL_CSS: [cite: 29]

* The `i_doc_asset` parameter from the MEM_DOC_ASSET data dictionary is replaced by `i_asset` from the new MEM_ASSET data dictionary [cite: 31]
* The `i_eval_date` parameter from the MEM_DOC_ASSET data dictionary is not present in the new MEM_ASSET data dictionary [cite: 31]

The following EVAL_SCEN_CSS functions are removed completely:

| Function removed   | Explanation                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cf_hor_in_years`  | Perpetuals need to have a call or put date otherwise no evaluation is possible |
| `use_par_flo`      | The new Avaloq kernel code now behaves as if use_par_flo is set to false    |
| `notnl_date_expr`  | Depended on `use_par_flo`                                                    |

The following functions are renamed: [cite: 33]

| Old function name in EVAL_SCEN_CSS | New function name in EVAL_CSS |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `pb_rfig_intr_calc_method_id`      | `intr_calc_method_id`         |
| `pb_rfig_compd_mtd_id`             | `compd_mtd_id`                |
| `pb_rfig_src_price_type_id`        | `src_price_type_id`           |
| `vlt_struct_collect_id`            | `vsc_id`                      |

The following functions have new default behaviour: [cite: 35]

| Function name           | New default setting in EVAL_CSS |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `opt_mdl_id`            | Null                            |
| `alw_vlt_fallbk`        | False                           |
| `intr_calc_method_id`   | Null                            |
| `compd_mtd_id`          | Null                            |
| `src_price_type_id`     | Null                            |

### 1.2 Use of MEM_ASSET instead of MEM_DOC_ASSET

**Note regarding de-release of classification 528 (previously announced in Financial Instruments Customization Upgrade Guide (Doc. ID: 4369), release 4.9):** [cite: 37]

If you are relying on classification 528 for downstream consumers, one solution would be to create your own derived classifications and classes to mimic the prior 528 classification. [cite: 37]
In Avaloq Core 5.7, the Asset Evaluation Engine customization no longer uses the MEM_DOC_ASSET data dictionary. [cite: 38] Instead it uses the new MEM_ASSET data dictionary. [cite: 39]

The following fields are no longer available; they are completely removed: [cite: 39]

| Field removed         | Description                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `block_id`            | It's redundant because the new Asset Evaluation Engine already discards template assets. [cite: 42]                   |
| `dflt_trade_curry_id` | Checking for exotic currencies can now be done with a derived class. [cite: 42]                                   |
| `outstand_pieces`     | Checking for jumbo bonds can now be done with a derived class. [cite: 42]                                         |
| `sort_alpha`          | This was derived from four keys: iso, tks, isin and sor_nr. The aim was to classify certain assets. This can now also be done using classes. [cite: 42] |
| `eff_date`            | The eff_date from the order DDIC is not available in the new MEM_ASSET data dictionary. The replacement has to be found on a case-by-case basis. [cite: 42] |

**Keys** [cite: 43]

Keys are no longer available the customization should not be asset or key specific. [cite: 43] If you still have such a use case, you should mark it with a specific class. [cite: 44]

**Additions** [cite: 45]

Additions are no longer available. They will have to be replaced with a corresponding class. [cite: 45]

**Classes**

All kernel classes are supported. [cite: 46] However the syntax used to access classes has changed: [cite: 46]

* Old pattern: `mem_doc_asset.obj_extn.classif_id` [cite: 46]
* New pattern: `mem_asset.class(classif_id)` [cite: 46]

Here's a code example using the old pattern: [cite: 46]

```sql
function opt_mdl_id (
    i_doc_asset mem_doc_asset,
    i_calc_md_scen_id id_table_code_md_scen,
    i_eval_date date
) return id_table_code_eval_mdl
is
begin
    if i_doc_asset.obj_extn.ass_type_id in (btt.asset.obj_extn.ass_type.class.cfc) then
        return code_eval_mdl.bn;
    else
        return null;
    end if;
exception
    when others then
        err.raise_fa('eval_scen_css.opt_mdl_id('||i_doc_asset||', '||i_calc_md_scen_id||', '||i_eval_date||')');
end opt_mdl_id;

nd here's a code example using the new pattern:  Â  

SQL

function opt_mdl_id(
    i_asset mem_asset,
    i_calc_md_scen_id id_table_code_md_scen
) return id_table_code_eval_mdl
is
begin
    if i_asset.class(btt.asset.obj_extn.ass_type_id) in (btt.asset.obj_extn.ass_type.class.cfc) then
        return code_eval_mdl.bn;
    else
        return null;
    end if;
exception
    when others then
        err.raise_fa('eval_css.opt_mdl_id('||i_asset||', '||i_calc_md_scen_id||')');
end opt_mdl_id;
